## Circular Dependency Plugin

Detect modules with circular dependencies when bundling with webpack.

Circular dependencies are often a necessity in complex software, the presence of a circular dependency doesn't always imply a bug, but in the case where you believe a bug exists, this module may help find it.

### Webpack Versions

The latest major version of this plugin `5`, supports webpack `4.0.1` and greater as a peer dependency. Major version `4` of this plugin and below are intended to support webpack `3.x.x` and below as a peer dependency.

### Basic Usage

```js
// webpack.config.js
const CircularDependencyPlugin = require('circular-dependency-plugin')

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index",
  plugins: [
    new CircularDependencyPlugin({
      // exclude detection of files based on a RegExp
      exclude: /a\.js|node_modules/,
      // include specific files based on a RegExp
      include: /dir/,
      // add errors to webpack instead of warnings
      failOnError: true,
      // allow import cycles that include an asyncronous import,
      // e.g. via import(/* webpackMode: "weak" */ './file.js')
      allowAsyncCycles: false,
      // set the current working directory for displaying module paths
      cwd: process.cwd(),
    })
  ]
}
```

### Advanced Usage

```js
// webpack.config.js
const CircularDependencyPlugin = require('circular-dependency-plugin')

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index",
  plugins: [
    new CircularDependencyPlugin({
      // `onStart` is called before the cycle detection starts
      onStart({ compilation }) {
        console.log('start detecting webpack modules cycles');
      },
      // `onDetected` is called for each module that is cyclical
      onDetected({ module: webpackModuleRecord, paths, compilation }) {
        // `paths` will be an Array of the relative module paths that make up the cycle
        // `module` will be the module record generated by webpack that caused the cycle
        compilation.errors.push(new Error(paths.join(' -> ')))
      },
      // `onEnd` is called before the cycle detection ends
      onEnd({ compilation }) {
        console.log('end detecting webpack modules cycles');
      },
    })
  ]
}
```

If you have some known circular dependencies and want to fail if any new ones are
introduced (or known ones are fixed/removed), you can use the life cycle methods to keep track of differences to known cycles.

```js
// webpack.config.js
const CircularDependencyPlugin = require('circular-dependency-plugin')

// We do not wanr about cycles that are listed here.
const knownCircularDependencies = ['src/file1.js -> src/file2.js -> src/file1.js'];
let foundCircularDependencies = [];

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index",
  plugins: [
    new CircularDependencyPlugin({
      onStart({ compilation }) {
        foundCircularDependencies = [];
      },
      onDetected({ module: webpackModuleRecord, paths, compilation }) {
        foundCircularDependencies.push(paths.join(' -> '));
      },
      onEnd({ compilation }) {
        const removedCircularDependencies = knownCircularDependencies
          .filter(knownCircularDependency => !foundCircularDependencies.includes(knownCircularDependency));
        const addedCircularDependencies = foundCircularDependencies
          .filter(foundCircularDependency => !knownCircularDependencies.includes(foundCircularDependency));
        
        if (addedCircularDependencies.length) {
          addedCircularDependencies.forEach(newCircularDependency =>
            compilation.warnings.push(`A new circular dependency was introduced:\n ${newCircularDependency}`)
          );
        } else if (removedCircularDependencies.length) {
          removedCircularDependencies.forEach(removedCircularDependency =>
            compilation.warnings.push(`A circular dependency was removed:\n ${removedCircularDependency}`)
          );
        }
      },
    })
  ]
}
```

### Maintenance

This module is maintained despite few changes being necessary, please open issues if you find any bugs relating to integration with webpack core.
